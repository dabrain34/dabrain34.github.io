My name is St√©phane and I'm a *free* software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain.

As a software developer, I have been following actively the [Free software](https://www.fsf.org/) philosophy
as well as the [open source initiative](https://opensource.org/about) in the industry all along my career.

For more than 10 years, working and gaining experience as a senior audio/video
software engineer with embedded system, I have been building strong relationships
with leading IC manufacturers as well as high end customers.

Adaptive, self starter, curious and relentless, I enjoy to work as a part of a solid team
as well as tackling new, exciting challenges on my own.
