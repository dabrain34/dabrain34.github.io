## My cross compiling journey with gst-build and GStreamer

### A brief Introduction

[gst-build](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-build/) is one of the two build system used by the community to hack into the whole GStreamer solution.
A previous [blogpost](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/) has been released to present gst-build and how to get started with it.

So I will go straight to the point regarding the cross compilation.

Here is my experience to perform a cross-build which can be very useful when you want to save precious build time or be able to work on both host and target with the same base code.

In this post, I will target an **aarch64** CPU for the [Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com/) reference board: **Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU106 Evaluation Kit**

#### Prerequisites

* Toolchain (aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc) + sysroot (optional)
* Meson cross file
* Meson > 0.54 (which is not available at the time of writing this blog post but the [merged bugfix patch](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/6461) in the official repository)

First we'll need here to have a proper toolchain to cross-build. In my case I used the regular toolchain provided by Ubuntu installing the packages:

```
$ sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu g++-aarch64-linux-gnu libc6-dev-arm64-cross
```

This is installing a minimal toolchain in `/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/`

#### Cross file generated with generate-cross-file.py

Below the cross file used to build for aarch64, this file has been generated with this [helper script](https://github.com/dabrain34/gstreamer-toolkit/blob/master/gst-build-helper/generate-cross-file.py) allowing to generated the cross file for other target as well.
As you can see, here, we don't use a dedicated *rootfs* because gst-build will build all that we need for the GStreamer essentials (including libffi, glib etc.).

```
$ ./generate-cross-file.py
```

```
[host_machine]
system = 'linux'
cpu_family = 'aarch64'
cpu = 'arm64'
endian = 'little'

[properties]
c_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
cpp_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
objc_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
objcpp_args = []
c_link_args = []
cpp_link_args = []
objc_link_args = []
objcpp_link_args = []
pkg_config_libdir = ['__unknown_sysroot__']


[binaries]
c = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc']
cpp = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-g++']
ar = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-ar']
pkgconfig = 'pkg-config'
strip = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-strip']

```

Here meson will use aarch64-linux-gnu-gxx to compile with the given arguments setup above. As meson does not recommend to use environment variables, the cross file contains hard-coded path to the sysroot to provide package config.
Indeed since meson > 0.54, you can define `pkg_config_libdir` which will help pkg-config to search for the package configuration files for the given target. You can also tell the path to the pkg-config wrapper by modifying the pkgconfig variables as well.
Predefined cross file can also be found in `gst-build/data/cross-files`


#### Configuring the project for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU106 Evaluation Board

When the cross file ready, we can now configure gst-build in order to have a dedicated build for our platform. Here I'm disabling some unnecessary options of gst-build such as libav, vaapi or gtk_doc.

Please ensure that you have the last meson version [necessary patch](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/6461), otherwise gst-build will take glib from the system (pkg_config_libdir prerequisite). Notice that on this platform, we use gst-omx, so we also give some options specific to this platform, in particular the path to the OpenMAX headers from Xilinx.

```
$ /path/to/meson_0_54 build-cross-arm64 --cross-file=my-meson-cross-file.txt -D omx=enabled -D sharp=disabled -D gst-omx:header_path=/opt/allegro-vcu-omx-il/omx_header -D gst-omx:target=zynqultrascaleplus -D libav=disabled -D rtsp_server=disabled -D vaapi=disabled -D disable_gst_omx=false -Dugly=disabled -Dgtk_doc=disabled -Dglib:libmount=false

```

After this step, you should be able to build with ninja.

```
$ ninja -C build-cross-arm64
```

#### Installing

Last but not the least, you need to install the artifacts in a folder to deploy on the device, for example, by mounting it your target with NFS. You have to provide a **DESTDIR** variable to ninja and it will install in `$DESTDIR/usr/local/` as install prefix.

```
$ DESTDIR=/opt/gst-build-cross-artifacts/linux_arm64 ninja -C build-cross-arm64 install
```

#### Running the binaries on target


After mounting the folder or copying it to your target, you have to set up a few variables to be able to run GStreamer pipelines:

 * PATH=$DESTDIR/usr/local/bin:$PATH
 * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DESTDIR/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 * GST_PLUGIN_PATH=$DESTDIR/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
 * GST_OMX_CONFIG_DIR=$DESTDIR/usr/local/etc/xdg

A [python script](https://github.com/dabrain34/gstreamer-toolkit/blob/master/gst-build-helper/cross-gst-uninstalled.py) is also available to setup the correct environment variables for your target.

```
$ /path_to/cross-gst-uninstalled.py /opt/gst-build-cross-artifacts/linux_arm64
```

#### Building wavpack in gst-plugins-good

To build a plugin such as wavpack which depends on the 3rd party [wavpack library](https://github.com/dbry/WavPack). You'll need to get a proper *sysroot* with this new library and its dependencies (if needed).

Regarding a root file-system with wavpack, I generated one with [cerbero](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero) where cross compiling could be described in a next blog post :) But you should normally have it as part of your *sysroot*.

```
$ cd /opt
$ git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/cerbero
$ cd cerbero
$ ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-lin-arm64.cbc bootstrap
$ ./cerbero-uninstalled -c config/cross-lin-arm64.cbc build wavpack

```

This should have generated a minimal root file-system in `/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64` which can used then with gst-build as a base root file-system.

You can now generate a new cross file with the given root file-system as parameter.

```
$ ./generate-cross-file.py --sysroot /opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64/ --no-include-sysroot
```

Here I define a *sysroot* to be be used but I'm disabling the use of `sys_root` in the cross file to avoid meson to tell pkg-config to prefix every path with this value. cerbero is generating pkg-config files with the sysroot path already in each pc files.

```
[host_machine]
system = 'linux'
cpu_family = 'aarch64'
cpu = 'arm64'
endian = 'little'

[properties]
c_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
cpp_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
objc_args = ['-Wall', '-g', '-O2']
objcpp_args = []
c_link_args = ['-L/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64', '-Wl,-rpath-link=/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64']
cpp_link_args = ['-L/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64', '-Wl,-rpath-link=/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64']
objc_link_args = ['-L/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64', '-Wl,-rpath-link=/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64']
objcpp_link_args = ['-L/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64', '-Wl,-rpath-link=/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64']
pkg_config_libdir = ['/opt/cerbero/build/dist/linux_arm64/pkgconfig:/opt/NFS/cerbero_rootfs/linux_arm64//usr/share/pkgconfig']


[binaries]
c = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc']
cpp = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-g++']
ar = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-ar']
pkgconfig = 'pkg-config'
strip = ['aarch64-linux-gnu-strip']
```

Now you should be able to go back to the configure/build/install step and get the wavpack in your plugins registry.

I hope you'll enjoy the use of gst-build, which is for me a very powerful and flexible tool.
A lot of options can be found in the gst-build [README](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-build/README.md) such as the update
or the use of GStreamer branches.
